Unlock Uzbekistan M&A: The Moratorium and "First-Time Chance" for Strategic Business Expansion

For business owners eyeing Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) in emerging markets, Uzbekistan presents a compelling case. As a rapidly growing economy in Central Asia, the country is actively creating a pro-business environment. The government has recently introduced significant measures—including a moratorium on new regulations and the "First-Time Chance" principle—that directly reduce risk and enhance predictability for investors, particularly those targeting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Understanding these reforms is crucial for developing a successful M&A strategy in Uzbekistan.

Moratorium: Protecting SMEs from New Regulatory Burden until January 1, 2028

Uzbekistan's government has implemented a moratorium on the adoption of new regulatory acts that impose additional obligations on small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). This moratorium is in effect from July 1, 2025, to January 1, 2028.

Stability for M&A Integration: This three-year regulatory freeze drastically reduces the risk of acquiring a target company only to face unforeseen compliance costs or new legal burdens shortly after closing. It provides a stable operating environment, allowing your post-M&A integration plan to proceed with greater certainty.

"New Rules from a Single Date" Principle: Furthermore, any new or strengthened regulations for other types of businesses will adhere to the "new rules from a single date" principle, coming into force only on January 1 or July 1 each year. This predictability gives businesses ample time to prepare for legal changes, which is a significant advantage during complex M&A due diligence and operational transitions.

Crucial Note: The moratorium has exceptions, such as acts aimed at eliminating emergency situations or aligning legislation with World Trade Organization (WTO) requirements. Thorough due diligence is necessary to confirm the target entity's operations are fully covered by this protective measure.

The "First-Time Chance" Principle: Mitigating Operational Risk in the First Year

Another key advantage for M&A targets that qualify as small businesses is the "First-Time Chance" principle, also effective until January 1, 2028.

Immunity from Liability: Under this principle, small business entities that commit an administrative offense in the field of trade and entrepreneurship for the first time during their first year of operation are generally exempt from administrative liability.

Lower Initial Risk for Acquirers: If your M&A involves a newly established small business, this rule provides a valuable grace period. It acknowledges that operational missteps can occur during the initial phase of a business, particularly when navigating a new country's regulatory landscape. It effectively lowers the risk tolerance required for acquiring young, promising ventures.

Facilitating Liquidation: Additionally, starting from September 1, 2025, small and medium-sized businesses undergoing voluntary liquidation may be exempt from a tax audit if they meet certain criteria (e.g., total income over three years does not exceed 10 billion UzSoums, no outstanding debts, and a low-risk assessment). This simplification can make the exit strategy component of your investment more attractive.

Summary

Uzbekistan's proactive stance on business reform, highlighted by the 2028 moratorium and the "First-Time Chance" principle, makes its market highly appealing for strategic M&A.

These reforms signal a government committed to fostering SME growth and providing regulatory stability, two factors that are paramount to successful cross-border investment. By leveraging the reduced regulatory risk and the mitigation of initial operational penalties, business owners are in a strong position to pursue strategic acquisitions in this dynamic Central Asian market. Work closely with local legal and M&A advisors to fully capitalize on these new protections.
