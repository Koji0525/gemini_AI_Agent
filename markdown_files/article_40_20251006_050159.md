Uzbekistan’s $1.68 Billion Privatization Wave: M&A Opportunities for Business Owners (2025–2028)

Uzbekistan, Central Asia’s rising economic power, is undergoing a historic, government-led economic liberalization. Under President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, the nation has committed to fundamentally transforming its market by drastically reducing the state’s role. This multi-year push towards large-scale privatization represents a critical and time-sensitive M&A window for international business owners and investors looking for high-growth assets in a strategically located market.

29 Major State-Owned Enterprises Up for Sale by 2028

The core of Uzbekistan’s economic roadmap centers on its ambitious privatization program, spanning from 2025 to 2028. This initiative is crucial for achieving the country's goal of doubling its GDP by the early part of the next decade, building on the 5.9% growth projected by the IMF for 2025.

The Auction Block: The State Assets Management Agency (SAMA) is preparing to sell government-owned shares in 29 of the country's largest state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through public tenders and auctions. These assets span high-value, strategic sectors.

Capital Market Strategy: In parallel, the government is preparing 12 major companies for IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) and SPOs (Secondary Public Offerings) on both international and domestic exchanges. The newly established $1.68 billion National Investment Fund (UzNIF), managed by US fund Franklin Templeton, will oversee the preparation of a large portfolio of these assets for listing, enhancing credibility and structure.

Strategic Sectors: M&A opportunities are concentrated in areas vital to the country's development, including energy, transport, metallurgy, aviation, telecommunications, and finance.

Targeting Key Assets and Ensuring Global Transparency

For strategic acquirers, the program offers a chance to gain immediate market share or expand existing operations by acquiring established entities. The government is actively seeking strategic foreign partners, not just financial investors, to bring new technology and management expertise.

High-Profile Opportunities: Noteworthy assets on the privatization list include automotive giant UzAuto Motors, the large-scale gas-to-liquids operation Uzbekistan GTL, and the mobile operator Mobiuz (Universal Mobile Systems). The government is looking to sell a 100% stake in Mobiuz, a significant deal that involves international advisors Rothschild & Co and KPMG to ensure a transparent, multi-stage process.

Banking Sector Reform: Even the financial sector is being transformed, with plans for the sale of state-owned banks, though the timeline for some has been adjusted to 2025-2027 to allow for necessary institutional reforms.

Investor Security: A key focus is on meeting international standards of transparency. The involvement of major international consultants in structuring these transactions provides a degree of assurance and predictability that was absent in previous eras, mitigating risk for foreign business owners.

Conclusion

Uzbekistan's 2025–2028 privatization push is not merely a divestiture of assets; it is a fundamental repositioning of the economy. The government is opening the door for foreign capital to become the new engine of growth. For business owners seeking high-yield investments in a dynamic, centrally-located market, this orchestrated wave of M&A and privatization offers a rare chance to acquire substantial, strategic assets in a transparent, internationally-advised process. Early engagement is essential to identify and secure the most valuable opportunities.
